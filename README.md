# MDLH: Case Study in LLM Hallucination and AI-Assisted Science Audit

*Purpose:* Document and analyze how large language models can amplify, correlate, and stabilize uncertain scientific claims across long multi-model workflows.

*Use case:* AI-safety case study for hallucination detection, provenance tracking, and reproducibility review in scientific and technical writing.

*Status:* Research case study. The project does not claim validation of the underlying physics material.

*Flag:* `experimental`

# LSC and Massively Documented LLM Hallucination

This project contains a publication-grade working paper:

**LSC and Massively Documented LLM Hallucination: A Dual-Interpretation Framework for AI-Assisted Scientific Discovery**

The work proposes **Massively Documented LLM Hallucination (MDLH)** as an epistemic-risk framework for AI-assisted science. It uses the public LSC neutrino research line as a case study while preserving a dual interpretation:

1. LSC as unvalidated speculative physics.
2. LSC as a possible AI-generated epistemic artifact.

The paper does **not** claim that LSC is correct. It also does **not** claim that LSC is false. Its purpose is to separate scientific validation from AI-assisted generation and documentation.

## Experimental Program

The repository now includes a dedicated experimental documentation track for
model-by-model provenance analysis. The goal is to separate:

- model input,
- claims added or removed,
- source-review status,
- and whether a change was scientific, editorial, or speculative.

The first lineage report records the progression:

- GPT: detector-bias reframing in LSC 5.0@
- Manus: integration and packaging in LSC 5.5
- Gemini: gap analysis and conservative reframing in LSC 6.2.0
- Codex: reproducibility and leave-one-out validation in LSC 6.2.1
- DeepSeek: formal review of LSC 6.2.0 consistency and defense gaps
- LSC 6.2.2: corrected continuation with explicit trace/anisotropy split and simulation outputs

## DeepSeek Review Snapshot

DeepSeek did not validate the theory. It identified concrete issues that need to
be fixed before any defense-oriented presentation:

- a dimensionally inconsistent detector term (`1 / E^2` appears in one formula
  but not the main ansatz),
- the trace-free tensor problem, which makes the pure anisotropy term average to
  zero in symmetric gallium setups,
- frame ambiguity for sidereal modulation,
- the need for experiment-specific likelihoods,
- and the need for leave-one-out stability checks.

## 6.2.2 Theory Update Snapshot

The 6.2.2 correction does not claim validation. It formalizes the repair path
triggered by the DeepSeek review:

- explicit isotropic trace,
- traceless anisotropy separated from the trace,
- fixed celestial frame for sidereal tests,
- deterministic simulation outputs for term decomposition and directional scans.

## Suggested Publication Order

Publish on GitHub first so changes, corrections, and review comments can be tracked. Publish on Zenodo after the GitHub version is stable enough to archive as a citable DOI.
